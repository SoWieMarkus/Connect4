# 4 wins - Granady

Connect 4 game which uses my <a href="https://github.com/SoWieMarkus/Games">Android Games Library</a>.

## Background

The app was created as a meme when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackmania">Trackmania</a> player <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/granadyy">GranaDy</a> managed to win the cup of the day four times in a row. The key part of the game Trackmania is to create tracks and drive them in the shortest possible time. The Cup of the day was introduced in the Trackmania 2020 game. Every evening at 7 p.m. CET / CEST, a community race track was selected and presented as the track of the day. At the same time, the cup of the day takes place on this track. All players who want can take part. In 15 minutes of qualification, the participants try to drive the fastest possible time. The times of the players are compared to all other times. At the end of the qualifying, the participants will be divided into groups of 64 players. That means: 

- 1.-64.: Server 1
- 65.-128.: Server 2 
etc.

The cup then takes place in knockout mode. All drivers drive the track. The slowest drivers are eliminated. In the end, the last player left wins. The winner of the Cup of the Day is the winner of Server 1.

The player GranaDy from Germany managed to win this cup four times in a row!

* Third win:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMtXSPHE-Xk
* Fourth win:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8qeYx9wnZg

This is how the meme with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">Connect 4</a> came about. 

To explain the name of the projet: GranaDy said he didn't know what the game was called in English. In German the game is called "Vier gewinnt.". He translated it word by word into English, which resulted in "Four wins". Only then did he look up the correct translation.
